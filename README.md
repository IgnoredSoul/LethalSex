## Advanced HUD:
- Voice
    - Three icons to indicate your voice level (None, Low, High).
    - Pressing your push-to-talk key on open mic will mute your mic, and vice versa.
- Stats
    - Added HP text :)

## Nervous Around Dogs: ~~*(I cant think of a good name)*~~
- When the player is near a dog, in-game mic settings are forced to be open and unmuted, ensuring dogs always hear you. ~~*(If you mute your actual mic, then you're a fucking pussy)*~~

- Settings will be restored when the player is not near the dog.

## Schizophrenia:
- When sanity is above 40 (80 seconds) and fear is above 0.4. Random noises will play from random distance, pitch and volume.

## Scared Doors:
- When walking through a door, the door has a 10% chance to slam shut.

## Future plans
- Sniff my balls
