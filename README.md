## Advanced HUD:
- Voice
    - Three icons to indicate your voice level (None, Low, High).
    - Pressing your push-to-talk key on open mic will mute your mic, and vice versa.
- Stats
    - Added HP text :)

## Nervous Around Dogs: ~~*(I cant think of a good name)*~~
- When the player is near a dog, in-game mic settings are forced to be open and unmuted, ensuring dogs always hear you. ~~*(If you mute your actual mic, then you're a fucking pussy)*~~

- Settings will be restored when the player is not near the dog.

## Worse Insanity:
- Added 3 sound phases based on your insanity level.
    - Phase 1: Random spoopy sound effects and noises
    - Phase 2: Breathing, voices and other sound effects
    - Phase 3: ***IM IN YOUR WALLS :)***

## Future plans
- Sniff my balls
