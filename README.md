## Advanced HUD:
- Voice
    - Three icons to indicate your voice level (None, Low, High).
    - Pressing your push-to-talk key on open mic will mute your mic, and vice versa.
- Stats
    - Added HP text :)

## Nervous Around Dogs: ~~*(I cant think of a good name)*~~
- When the player is near a dog, in-game mic settings are forced to be open and unmuted, ensuring dogs always hear you. ~~*(If you mute your actual mic, then you're a fucking pussy)*~~

- Settings will be restored when the player is not near the dog.

## Schizophrenia:
### Insanity levels:
- When player has reached insanity of 20:
    - You will start to hear distant noises
    - Your vision will become a little grainer
    - Your vision will narrow

- When player has reached insanity of 38:
    - You will start to hear more noises more often
    - Your vision becomes more unstable causing chromatic aberration and lens distortion

- When player has reached insanity of 50:
    - The noises... wont stop... they're in your walls...
    - Your vision is basically useless now. You need to go to specsavers mate.

## Scared Doors:
- When walking through a door, the door has a 10% chance to play the sound of the door slamming shut after (0.85s - 2.56s).
    - 1% chance it will actually close but only for you.
- If the player re-enteres through the door before the timer is done, task will be stopped and will again have a 10% chance to slam

## Future plans
- Sniff my balls
