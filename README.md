## LethalSex-Core

LethalSex-Core is a core dependency used for other mods in this repository. It enables easier creation of new mods and provides better event handling. This mod is required for all other mods and includes a developer menu and console, which can be activated in the configuration.

## LethalSanity

LethalSanity extends the Insanity system inside the game, using it against the player. As your insanity grows, stranger things happen to you both visually and aurally. Your vision becomes increasingly impaired, with distorted visuals and hallucinations. The mod introduces auditory hallucinations, such as eerie sounds and voices, and there's even a chance of encountering hallucinated creatures that aren't really there. Embrace the challenge of maintaining your sanity as you navigate through the factory.

  <p>
    LethalSanity takes the Insanity system to new heights, providing a deeply immersive and "slightly scary" experience for players. As you delve deeper into madness, the game environment becomes increasingly surreal, with visual distortions and auditory hallucinations that keep you on edge.

Currently there is visual effects (post processing) and "new" scrap. I am too stupid to add monsters right now and too much of a perfectionist when it comes to the audio handler... oopsies :3
